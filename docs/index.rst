Welcome to libswid's documentation!
===================================

libswid is a library that aims to help developers to deal with `SWID tags <https://tagvault.org/swid-tags/what-are-swid-tags/>`_.

Quote from the website:

  Software identification tags (SWID tags) record unique information about an installed software application, including its name, edition, version, whether it is part of a bundle and more.
  SWID tags support software inventory and asset management initiatives.
  The structure of SWID tags is specified in international standard ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015.

libswid aims to provide a base, that tool developers will use to build support tools for their target audience:

* Software developers: Developers of any software should make sure that they distribute SWID metadata to their users, or even to redistributors.

* System administrators: Sysadmins need tools to deduce or validate system state from a set of SWID tags.
